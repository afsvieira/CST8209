# CST8209 - Calendar of Events

This project is part of the CST8209 - Web Programming I course. It implements a dynamic and interactive **Calendar of Events** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery), and jQuery UI. The application allows users to create events with a date, title, and description while dynamically updating a calendar interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Calendar**: Displays the days of the selected month and updates for previous or next months.
- **Event Management**:
  - Add events with a title, description, and date.
  - Validate form inputs with error messages.
  - Display a summary of total events added.
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Responsive design.
  - Styled using custom CSS for better user experience.
  - Integrated jQuery datepicker and event listeners.
- **Validation**:
  - Ensures proper date and title input with error handling for incorrect entries.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the calendar and form.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity and event handling.
- **jQuery**: For DOM manipulation and event-driven functionality.
- **jQuery UI**: For the datepicker component.
